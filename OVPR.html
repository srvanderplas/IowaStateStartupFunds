Point color again indicates department, so that any department-level trends are potentially visible. The most noticable changes are present in the Colleges of Ag &amp; Life Science, Human Sciences, Veterinary Medicine, and Engineering (to a lesser degree): In these colleges, there are some hires whose funding package is dominated by computer equipment, but this becomes less common over time.</p>The next graph examines the amount of startup funding allocated to computer equipment over time. We have utilized a square-root transformation on the y-axis to display both the $1000 allocations and the $100K allocations in the same plot more easily.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/ComputingExpenseAmount-1.png" title="Amount allocated for computers" alt="Amount allocated for computers" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>We see that most colleges provide enough startup funding for a basic laptop or desktop system (if that), but higher awards are common in Engineering (where lab equipment, sample probes, etc. are potentially part of the computing category) and Ag &amp; Life Science (where specific computing needs for sequence analysis, etc. can be quite expensive).</p><p>In Ag &amp; Life Science, the computer funding allocation may have decreased due to Moore’s law (it’s cheaper to get computers that can process genetic data now than it was in 2005). Engineering allocations seem to be somewhat department-related (clustering of green and blue values, in particular). The business school seems remarkably standardized - the amount decreased in 2011-2013, but otherwise has been at approximately the same level (with extremely low variance).</p>Examining the College of Engineering on a department level, we find that trends in computer allocation amounts are largely department-dependent. This graph again shows the funding amount on the y-axis (using a linear scale this time), the year on the x-axis (points have been “jittered” to prevent overplotting). In addition, the regression line shown models the funding amount over time (using poisson regression).<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/ComputingExpenseEngineering-1.png" title="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Engineering" alt="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Engineering" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>We can see that in many departments, the computer allocation has increased over time. The Mechanical Engineering department in particular has seen a dramatic increease in startup computer funding over time, such that hires after 2013 receive at least $15K in computer funding. The Aerospace Engineering department shows a similar trend (though not all hires receive higher computer funding in that department). The Materials Science &amp; Engineering department is also interesting; while most hires received minimal computer funding, four hires received more funding, with the hires before 2010 receiveing over $100K in funding for computer equipment. This could be happenstance, but may also be indicative of a department composed of computational and non-computational members.</p>We will similarly explore the College of Ag &amp; Life Sciences to determine whether computer equipment funding has changed on a department level over time.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/ComputingExpenseAGLS-1.png" title="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Ag & Life Sciences" alt="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Ag & Life Sciences" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>Again, we have the amount of startup funding dedicated to computer equipment on the y-axis, and time of hire on the x-axis. Departmental hires are shown as points, with an overall poisson regression line (where possible) shown in blue. Computer startup funding for ABE and PLPM departments has increased over time, while startup funding for computer equipment in several other departments has decreased over time (AgEd, Econ, BBMB, ENT, Hort, Soc).</p>Finally, we examine the College of Human Sciences at the deparment level<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/ComputingExpenseHumSci-1.png" title="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Human Sciences" alt="Amount allocated for computers in the College of Human Sciences" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>As seen in other colleges, startup funding for computers in some departments has increaseed over time (Kinesiology, AESHM, C&amp;I) while funding in other departments has decreased over time (SOE, FSHN, HDFS). Overall, this has resulted in a slight increase in startup funding for the college.</p></div><div id="lab-spaceequipment-expenses" class="section level1"><h1>Lab Space/Equipment Expenses</h1><p>Next, we consider startup funding for lab space and equipment. We expect that lab space is a large component of startup packages within some colleges (Ag &amp; Life Science, Engineering, LAS), and that even within colleges, funding levels may vary by department.</p>First, we examine the proportion of the startup package allocated to lab space and equipment over time, by college. In Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, this proportion seems to decrease (for the few LAS hires who received startup funding for lab space and equipment), but in other colleges this seems to have remained fairly consistent over time.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabExpenseProp-1.png" title="Proportion of startup $ allocated for lab space and equipment." alt="Proportion of startup $ allocated for lab space and equipment." width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>Next, we consider the amount of startup funding allocated for lab space and equipment over time. As before, the raw amount of funding in LAS has decreased over time for those in LAS who require lab space. In Engineering, recent hires have all been provided funding for lab space and equipment, in contrast with previous years, where many hires were not provided with such funding.</p><div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabExpenseAmount-1.png" title="Amount allocated for lab space and equpment" alt="Amount allocated for lab space and equpment" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>We next consider the department-level funding for each of the colleges where lab space and funding is common.</p>We begin with the College of Ag &amp; Life Sciences. In many departments, the funding for lab space has not changed significantly over time. Startup funding for lab space has increased in Horticulture, NREM, and PLPM over the past 10 years, while funding for lab space in GDCB, ENT, and ABE have decreased over the past decade.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabFundingAGLS-1.png" title="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Ag & Life Sciences" alt="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Ag & Life Sciences" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>Next, we consider the College of Engineering. Interestingly, the ABE department (Ag &amp; Biological Engineering) is shared across the College of Engineering and the College of Ag &amp; Life Sciences, and while funding for lab space decreased in AGLS for the ABE department over the past decade, lab funding for hires in the ABE department increased in the College of Engineering. Lab funding also increased for the ECpE, CBE, and MSE departments, and decreased for the IMSE and AerE departments. This may reflect changes in discipline norms (i.e. research that once required a lab can now be conducted with computer simulations) in addition to changes in departmental funding policy.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabFundingEngr-1.png" title="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Engineering" alt="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Engineering" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>In the College of Human Sciences, startup funding for lab equipment has increased in many departments, decreasing only in the C&amp;I department (and that decrease could well be a result of random chance). The Kinesiology and FSHN departments show a universal increase in startup funding for equipment and lab space, while the AESHM department has increased funding for only some hires (most hires still receive no funding for lab space and equipment).<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabFundingHumSci-1.png" title="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Human Sciences" alt="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Human Sciences" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>Finally, in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Science, startup funding for lab equipment is only common in the “Science” portion of the college, and has declined across all of those departments.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/LabFundingLAS-1.png" title="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences" alt="Amount allocated for Lab and Equipment Funding in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div></div><div id="graduate-assistant-expenses" class="section level1"><h1>Graduate Assistant Expenses</h1>Next, we examine the amount of startup funding allocated to graduate assistant support.

The College of Human Sciences is allocating proportionately more money to graduate student support now than was common 10 years ago, though the Business, Design, and Engineering colleges have also increased startup funding for graduate student support.</p><p>Next, examining the raw amount of funding allocated for graduate student support, we find that the same trend generally holds. In the graph below, funding amount is shown on the y-axis, with a poisson regression line fit to the funding amount. Again, the College of Human Sciences has increased funding amounts over the past decade, followed by the College of Design, College of Engineering, and College of Business.

Departments which have never allocated startup funding for graduate student support have been excluded from the graph below to conserve space.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/GradExpenseAmtLAS-1.png" title="Amount allocated for graduate assistant support" alt="Amount allocated for graduate assistant support" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>It is evident that in some departments (Chem, Econ, GeAt, Soc, Stat, WL&amp;C) startup funding is almost never provided. Regression lines have not been fit for the majority of these departments. Startup funding for graduate students in Psychology has increased over the last decade, but funding in the Journalism department has declined.</p></div><div id="summer-support" class="section level1"><h1>Summer Support</h1>Next, we consider the proportion of startup funding that is allocated for summer support. In some colleges, summer support makes up most of the startup package; in others, summer support is uncommon. Over time, there may be a small increease in the proportion of a startup package allocated to summer funding in LAS, with a possible small decrease in Business.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/SummerExpenseProp-1.png" title="Proportion of startup $ allocated for summer support." alt="Proportion of startup $ allocated for summer support." width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>Examining the actual amounts of funding provided for summer support by college, we find that the amount of startup funding allocated for summer support has increased in most colleges over time, has stayed the same in the Business college, and has decreased in the College of Veterinary Medicine (though it was extremely uncommon that someone would get summer funding at all). The amount of funding also varies widely by college; in Engineering, startup funding for summer support has increeased from about $25000 in 2005 to about $50000 in 2015, while in LAS, the increase was from about $5000 to about $10000 over the same period.</p><div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/SummerExpenseAmount-1.png" title="Amount of startup $ allocated for summer support." alt="Amount of startup $ allocated for summer support." width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>Summer funding seems to be fairly common in some areas (business, some of LAS) and almost unheard of in others (design, vet med). Next, we examine the colleges where summer funding is typically a non-zero component of the startup package.</p>In the college of Ag &amp; Life Science, summer support is increasing in many departments (though it has declined in others, such as Animal Science). Departments with fewer than 4 data points or fewer than 2 unique data points are excluded as regressions could not be accurately fit.

Whereas in LAS summer support was a small proportion of starting salary, in the Business college, summer supprt is more generous (possibly because it covers more years than support in LAS). The amount of support has declined in Management, stayed approximately the same in Accounting, SCIS, and Marketing, and increased with salary level in Finance.<br /><div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="OVPR_files/figure-html/SummerExpenseAmountBus-1.png" title="Amount of startup $ allocated for summer support." alt="Amount of startup $ allocated for summer support." width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>In the College of Engineering, summer support is increasing relative to starting salary in several departments (AerE, CCEE, IMSE, ME, MSE).
