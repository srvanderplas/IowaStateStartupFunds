We split this by college and faculty rank (as we’d expect that full professors who are hired should be able to command grant money sooner than new faculty). Subsequent graphs show data from hired professors (i.e. not adjuncts, affiliates, lecturers, or clinicians).</p><div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="StartupFunds_files/figure-html/YearsAtISUGrants-1.png" title="" alt="" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div><p>The most noticeable difference between colleges is that in engineering, assistant professors get grants about five years after they are hired, and it is very rare for professors at that stage in their careers not to get grant funding. This trend is present (though less pronounced) in Ag &amp; Life Sciences and Human Sciences as well, though some assistant professors in those colleges seem to get funding much earlier in their careers (perhaps because of large grants given to groups of professors). In Liberal Arts and Sciences, grant funding does seem to increase with experience for some hires, but perhaps because LAS includes both arts (which are less grant-reliant) and sciences, this trend is less pronounced than in other colleges.</p><p>In order to examine the effect of startup funding on grant receipts over a career of variable duration, we will examine the distribution of startup funding by college, categorizing startup costs by the quartile (calculated for the hire’s college).

Additionally, different colleges have different funding structures: LAS, for instance, may need to provide lab startup funding for science based departments, but would not have to provide this funding for new hires in English or History.

In Chemistry, Physics, BBMB, EEOB, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, and Math, the career trajectory of grant proposals suggests that the large startup packages are worthwhile investments; these disciplines are also largely in the top two quartiles for startup funding. Psychology is more of a mixed bag; many psychologists received large startup packages but have not received significant grant funding. Disciplines with more economical startup packages are also less likely to have faculty receiving large grants; this is likely due to discipline norms, rather than faculty quality.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="StartupFunds_files/figure-html/YearsTotalCostGrantsLAS-1.png" title="" alt="" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>By comparison, the College of Engineering is fairly consistent; some departments have more startup funding (MSE, CBE), but overall, grant receipts are largely similar (though there is not sufficient data for Ag &amp; Biosystems Engineering to determine whether that department receives grants at the same rate as other departments). Grant funding may increase slightly over the course of a career (there are increases in AerE, MSE, and ME that are fairly consistent). After 2 years, most hires will have received at least $100,000 in grant funding, and many hires will have received at least one million in cumulative grants after 5-6 years. Startup funding does not seem to affect these trends in a significant way, except that more recent hires seem more likely to receive large startup packages, and are less likely to have received grant money at this point in their careers.<br /><div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="StartupFunds_files/figure-html/YearsTotalCostGrantEngr-1.png" title="" alt="" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>Examining the College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences, we find again that different departments have different startup funding resources, but that within a department, startup funding does not seem to greatly predict later grant receipts.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="StartupFunds_files/figure-html/YearsTotalCostGrantAGLS-1.png" title="" alt="" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>Examining the College of Human Sciences, we find again that different departments have different startup funding resources; Food Science and Human Nutrition in particular tends to have more startup funding than other departments, while the School of Education has a uniquely time-dependent startup funding allocation - hires from FY06-FY10 are typically in the first quartile of startup package funding, while hires from FY11-FY13 are typically in the second quadrant, and hires from FY13-FY15 are typically in the third quadrant. In the school of education, at least, startup funding (relative to others hired at approximately the same time) seems to be associated with a higher probability of grant receipts, at least in part because those hired as Associate and Full professors (circled values in the graph) can command higher startup packages and seem somewhat more likely to receive grant funding.<div class="row"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="StartupFunds_files/figure-html/YearsTotalCostGrantHumSci-1.png" title="" alt="" width="100%" /></a></div></div></div>Examining the College of Veterinary Medicine, we find great differences in grant receipts between departments; grants are almost unheard of in Veterinary Pathology, but are reasonably common in Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine.
